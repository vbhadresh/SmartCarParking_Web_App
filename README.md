# SmartCarParking_Web_Application
Here we discuss a smart parking assistance for the people who use a multi story
& large parking spaces in metropolitan cities. In this busy world everyone needs everything to be faster. 
Finding a free parking slot in a parking area is very difficult and there are scenarios where people usually 
lose path in parking lots in the process of finding their vehicle. To overcome the above problem, we can use a unique method 
called SMART PARKING & TRACKING methods to obtain faster parking and reduce the traffic, 
congestion and time consumption inside the parking area. In addition, it provides easy access to 
track the vehicle on return. To automate the SMART PARKING ASSISTANCE we need to capture the image of the number plate 
for every vehicle and print it on the token & at the entrance the graphical guidance path is displayed to the driver, 
so he can easily drive to the particular parking slot. To track the vehicle, we can make use of IMAGE PROCESSING concepts
where we scan the image using devices like camera connected to kiosk, we obtain the path view that is generated so that
the driver can easily find his vehicle in the lot. We are developing a mobile application where the user can book a parking 
slot and park the vehicle within a time frame of 30 minutes. The booking will get refreshed after the turn around time.
